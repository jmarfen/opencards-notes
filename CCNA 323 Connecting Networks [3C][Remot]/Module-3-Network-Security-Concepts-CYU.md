<!-- Module 3: Network Security Concepts -->

<!-- 3.1: Current State of Cybersecurity -->

##  is anything of value to the organization. It includes people, equipment, resources, and data.

- Assets

## is a weakness in a system, or its design, that could be exploited by a threat.

- Vulnerability

## is a potential danger to a company’s assets, data, or network functionality.

- Threat

## is a mechanism that takes advantage of a vulnerability.

- Exploit

## is the counter-measure that reduces the likelihood or severity of a potential threat or risk. Network security involves multiple mitigation techniques.

- Mitigation

## is the likelihood of a threat to exploit the vulnerability of an asset, with the aim of negatively affecting an organization.

- Risk

## the probability of the occurrence of an event and its consequences.

- Risk

## is a path by which a threat actor can gain access to a server, host, or network. 

- Attack vector

## this attack occurs when a network device or application is incapacitated and no longer capable of supporting requests from legitimate users.

- DoS attack

## an organization’s most valuable asset.

- Data

## What are some common data loss vectors?

- Email/Social Networking
- Unencrypted Devices
- Cloud Storage Devices
- Removable Media
- Hard Copy
- Improper Access Control

## Identify the data loss vector: Intercepted email or IM messages could be captured and reveal confidential information.

- Email/Social Networking

## Identify the data loss vector: If the data is not stored using an encryption algorithm, then the thief can retrieve valuable confidential data.

- Unencrypted Devices

## Identify the data loss vector:     Sensitive data can be lost if access to the cloud is compromised due to weak security settings.

- Cloud Storage Devices

## Identify the data loss vector: One risk is that an employee could perform an unauthorized transfer of data to a USB drive. Another risk is that a USB drive containing valuable corporate data could be lost.

- Removable Media

## Identify the data loss vector: Passwords or weak passwords which have been compromised can provide a threat actor with easy access to corporate data.

- Improper Access Control
