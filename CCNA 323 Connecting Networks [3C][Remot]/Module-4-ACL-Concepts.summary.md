<!-- Module 4: ACL Concepts -->

## is a series of IOS commands that are used to filter packets based on information found in the packet header

- ACL

## a sequential list of permit or deny statements used by ACLs

- ACEs

## Cisco routers support two types of ACLs:

- standard ACLs
- extended ACLs

## This ACL filters packets before they are routed to the outbound interface

- inbound ACL

## This ACL filters packets after being routed, regardless of the inbound interface

- outbound ACL

## An IPv4 ACE uses a ____-bit wildcard mask to determine which bits of the address to examine for a match.

- 32

## is similar to a subnet mask in that it uses the ANDing process to identify which bits in an IPv4 address to match

- wildcard mask

## Wildcard mask bit ____ matches the corresponding bit value in the address. Wildcard mask bit ____ ignores the corresponding bit value in the address.

- 0, 1

## a dual-stacked (i.e, IPv4 and IPv6) router interface can have up to ____ ACLs applied

- 4

## These ACLs permit or deny packets based only on the source IPv4 address

- Standard ACLs

## These ACLs permit or deny packets based on the source IPv4 address and destination IPv4 address, protocol type, source and destination TCP or UDP ports and more.

- Extended ACLs

## What is the range of numbers for standard ACLs?

1-99, or 1300-1999

## What is the range of numbers for extended ACLs?

- 100-199, or 2000 to 2699

## Where should extended ACLs be located?

- as close as possible to the source of the traffic to be filtered

## Where should standard ACLs be located?

- as close to the destination as possible.
