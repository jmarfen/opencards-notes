<!-- Module 7: WAN Concepts -->

## Type of network required to connect beyond the boundary of the LAN

- Wide Area Network (WAN)

## is a telecommunications network that spans over a relatively large geographical area

- Wide Area Network (WAN)

## is a connection that is dedicated to a single customer

- private WAN

## is a connection typically provided by an ISP or telecommunications service provider using the internet

- public WAN

##  WANs are implemented using the following logical topologies:

- Point-to-Point
- Hub-and-Spoke
- Dual-homed
- Fully Meshed
- Partially Meshed

## a connection where an organization connects to only one service provider

- single-carrier connection

## Unlike single-carrier connection, this provides redundancy and increases network availability

- dual-carrier connection

## interconnects several LANs within a limited geographical area

- Campus Area Network (CAN)

## is larger than a LAN but smaller than a WAN

- metropolitan area network (MAN) 

## interconnect sites within a city

- metropolitan area network (MAN) 

## ____ describe the electrical, mechanical, and operational components needed to transmit bits over a WAN

- Layer 1 protocols

## ____ define how data will be encapsulated into a frame

- Layer 2 protocols

## transmits bits sequentially over a single channel

- Serial communication

## simultaneously transmit several bits using multiple wires

- parallel communications
