<!-- Module 3: Network Security Concepts -->

## includes hackers and any device, person, group, or nation state that is, intentionally or unintentionally, the source of an attack

- threat actor

## they operate in an underground economy where they buy, sell, and trade attack toolkits, zero day exploit code, botnet services, banking Trojans, keyloggers, and more

- cyber criminals

## this type of hacking involves many different types of tools used to test the network and keep its data secure

- ethical hacking

## List some common types of attacks

- eavesdropping
- data modification
- IP address spoofing
- denial-of-service
- man-in-the-middle,
- compromised-key
- sniffer.

##  The three most common types of malware are

- worms
- viruses
- trojan horses

## this malware executes arbitrary code and installs copies of itself in the memory of the infected computer.

- worm

## Networks are susceptible to the following types of attacks

- reconnaissance
- access
- DoS

## Threat actors use ____ attacks to do unauthorized discovery and mapping of systems, services, or vulnerabilities

- reconnaissance

## ____ attacks exploit known vulnerabilities in authentication services, FTP services, and web services

- access

## Types of access attacks are: 

- password 
- spoofing
- trust exploitations 
- port redirections 
- man-in-the-middle
- buffer overflow

## is an access attack that attempts to manipulate individuals into performing actions or divulging confidential information

- social engineering

## are attacks that create some sort of interruption of network services to users, devices, or applications.

- DoS/DDoS attacks

## this information appears immediately after the IP header

- TCP segment information

## TCP attacks include: 

- TCPSYN Flood attack
- TCP reset attack
- TCP Session hijacking

## this protocol is commonly used by DNS, TFTP, NFS, and SNMP. It is also used with real-time applications such as media streaming or VoIP

- UDP

## an unsolicited ARP Reply

- gratuitous ARP

## DNS attacks include

- open resolver attacks
- stealth attacks
- domain shadowing attacks
- tunneling attacks

## this attack occurs when a rogue DHCP server is connected to the network and provides false IP configuration parameters to legitimate clients.

- DHCP spoofing attack

## the information security triad:

- confidentiality
- integrity
- availability

## is a system, or group of systems, that enforces an access control policy between networks

- firewall

## The four elements of secure communications are:

- data integrity
- origin authentication
- data confidentiality 
- data non-repudiation

## these functions guarantee that message data has not changed accidentally or intentionally

- hash functions

## Three well-known hash functions are

- MD5 with 128-bit digest
- SHA hashing algorithm
- SHA-2

## this code is calculated using any cryptographic algorithm that combines a cryptographic hash function with a secret key

- keyed-hash message authentication code (HMAC)
