<!-- Check Your Understanding - TCP and UDP Vulnerabilities -->

## Which attack exploits the three-way handshake?

- TCP SYN Flood attack

## Two hosts have established a TCP connection and are exchanging data. A threat actor sends a TCP segment with the RST bit set to both hosts informing them to immediately stop using the TCP connection. Which attack is this?

- TCP reset attack

## Which attack is being used when the threat actor spoofs the IP address of one host, predicts the next sequence number, and sends an ACK to the other host?

- TCP session hijacking

## A program sends a flood of UDP packets from a spoofed host to a server on the subnet sweeping through all the known UDP ports looking for closed ports. This will cause the server to reply with an ICMP port unreachable message. Which attack is this?

- UDP flood attack
