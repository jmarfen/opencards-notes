<!-- 3.3: Threat Actor Tools -->

## often referred to as password recovery tools. This is accomplished either by removing the original password, after bypassing the data encryption, or by outright discovery of the password. These tools repeatedly make guesses in order to crack the password. Examples of password cracking tools include John the Ripper, Ophcrack, L0phtCrack, THC Hydra, RainbowCrack, and Medusa.

- Password Crackers

## are used to intentionally hack into a wireless network to detect security vulnerabilities. 

- Wireless Hacking Tools

## are used to probe network devices, servers, and hosts for open TCP or UDP ports

- Network Scanning and
Hacking Tools

## These tools are used to probe and test a firewall’s robustness using specially crafted forged packets

- Packet Crafting Tools

## These tools are used to capture and analyze packets within traditional Ethernet LANs or WLANs

- Packet Sniffers

## This is a directory and file integrity checker used by white hats to detect installed root kits. Example tools include AIDE, Netfilter, and PF: OpenBSD Packet Filter.

- Rootkit Detectors

## Fuzzers are tools used by threat actors to discover a computer’s security vulnerabilities. Examples of fuzzers include Skipfish, Wapiti, and W3af.

- Fuzzers to Search Vulnerabilities

## These tools are used by white hat hackers to sniff out any trace of evidence existing in a computer. Example of tools include Sleuth Kit, Helix, Maltego, and Encase.

- Forensic Tools

## These tools are used by black hats to reverse engineer binary files when writing exploits. They are also used by white hats when analyzing malware. Debugging tools include GDB, WinDbg, IDA Pro, and Immunity Debugger.

- Debuggers

## These are specially designed operating systems preloaded with tools optimized for hacking. Examples of specially designed hacking operating systems include Kali Linux, Knoppix, BackBox Linux.

- Hacking Operating Systems

## These tools use algorithm schemes to encode the data to prevent unauthorized access to the encrypted data. Examples of these tools include VeraCrypt, CipherShed, OpenSSH, OpenSSL, Tor, OpenVPN, and Stunnel.

- Encryption Tools

## These tools identify whether a remote host is vulnerable to a security attack. Examples of vulnerability exploitation tools include Metasploit, Core Impact, Sqlmap, Social Engineer Toolkit, and Netsparker.

- Vulnerability Exploitation Tools

## These tools scan a network or system to identify open ports. They can also be used to scan for known vulnerabilities and scan VMs, BYOD devices, and client databases. Examples of tools include Nipper, Secunia PSI, Core Impact, Nessus v6, SAINT, and Open VAS.

- Vulnerability Scanners

## This is when a threat actor captures and “listens” to network traffic. This attack is also referred to as sniffing or snooping.

- Eavesdropping Attack

## If threat actors have captured enterprise traffic, they can alter the data in the packet without the knowledge of the sender or receiver.

- Data Modification Attack

## A threat actor constructs an IP packet that appears to originate from a valid address inside the corporate intranet.

- IP Address Spoofing Attack

## If threat actors discover a valid user account, the threat actors have the same rights as the real user. Threat actors could use that valid account to obtain lists of other users, network information, change server and network configurations, and modify, reroute, or delete data.

- Password-Based Attacks

## This attack prevents normal use of a computer or network by valid users. A DoS attack can flood a computer or the entire network with traffic until a shutdown occurs because of the overload. A DoS attack can also block traffic, which results in a loss of access to network resources by authorized users.

- Denial of Service Attack

## This attack occurs when threat actors have positioned themselves between a source and destination. They can now actively monitor, capture, and control the communication transparently.

- Man-in-the-Middle Attack

## This attack happens when a threat actor obtains a secret key, A compromised key can be used to gain access to a secured communication without the sender or receiver being aware of the attack.

- Compromised-Key Attack

## An attack conducted using a sniffer. A sniffer is an application or device that can read, monitor, and capture network data exchanges and read network packets. If the packets are not encrypted, a sniffer provides a full view of the data inside the packet.
