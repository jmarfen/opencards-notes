## often referred to as password recovery tools. This is accomplished either by removing the original password, after bypassing the data encryption, or by outright discovery of the password. These tools repeatedly make guesses in order to crack the password.

- Password Crackers

##  Examples of password cracking tools include:

- John the Ripper
- Ophcrack
- L0phtCrack
- THC Hydra
- RainbowCrack
- Medusa

## are used to intentionally hack into a wireless network to detect security vulnerabilities. 

- Wireless Hacking Tools

## are used to probe network devices, servers, and hosts for open TCP or UDP ports

- Network Scanning and
Hacking Tools

## These tools are used to probe and test a firewall’s robustness using specially crafted forged packets

- Packet Crafting Tools
