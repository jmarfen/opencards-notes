## Threat actors send spoofed, falsified record resource (RR) information to a DNS resolver to redirect users from legitimate sites to malicious sites.

- DNS cache poisoning attacks

## Threat actors use DoS or DDoS attacks on DNS open resolvers to increase the volume of attacks and to hide the true source of an attack

- DNS amplification and reflection attacks

## A DoS attack that consumes the resources of the DNS open resolvers. This DoS attack consumes all the available resources to negatively affect the operations of the DNS open resolver

- DNS resource utilization attacks

## Threat actors use this technique to hide their phishing and malware delivery sites behind a quickly-changing network of compromised DNS hosts. The DNS IP addresses are continuously changed within minutes

- Fast Flux

## Threat actors use this technique to rapidly change the hostname to IP address mappings and to also change the authoritative name server

- Double IP Flux

## Threat actors use this technique in malware to randomly generate domain names that can then be used as rendezvous points to their command and control (C&C) servers.

- Domain Generation Algorithms

## Threat actors use this method to place non-DNS traffic within DNS traffic. This method often circumvents security solutions when a threat actor wishes to communicate with bots inside a protected network, or exfiltrate data from the organization, such as a password database

- DNS Tunneling

## occurs when a rogue DHCP server is connected to the network and provides false IP configuration parameters to legitimate clients

- DHCP Spoofing Attack
