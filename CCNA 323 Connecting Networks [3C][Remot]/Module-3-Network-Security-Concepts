<!-- Module 3: Network Security Concepts -->

<!-- 3.1: Current State of Cybersecurity -->

##  is anything of value to the organization. It includes people, equipment, resources, and data.

- Assets

## is a weakness in a system, or its design, that could be exploited by a threat.

- Vulnerability

## is a potential danger to a company’s assets, data, or network functionality.

- Threat

## is a mechanism that takes advantage of a vulnerability.

- Exploit

## is the counter-measure that reduces the likelihood or severity of a potential threat or risk. Network security involves multiple mitigation techniques.

- Mitigation

## is the likelihood of a threat to exploit the vulnerability of an asset, with the aim of negatively affecting an organization.

- Risk

## the probability of the occurrence of an event and its consequences.

- Risk

## is a path by which a threat actor can gain access to a server, host, or network. 

- Attack vector

## this attack occurs when a network device or application is incapacitated and no longer capable of supporting requests from legitimate users.

- DoS attack

## an organization’s most valuable asset.

- Data

## What are some common data loss vectors?

- Email/Social Networking
- Unencrypted Devices
- Cloud Storage Devices
- Removable Media
- Hard Copy
- Improper Access Control

## Identify the data loss vector: Intercepted email or IM messages could be captured and reveal confidential information.

- Email/Social Networking

## Identify the data loss vector: If the data is not stored using an encryption algorithm, then the thief can retrieve valuable confidential data.

- Unencrypted Devices

## Identify the data loss vector:     Sensitive data can be lost if access to the cloud is compromised due to weak security settings.

- Cloud Storage Devices

## Identify the data loss vector: One risk is that an employee could perform an unauthorized transfer of data to a USB drive. Another risk is that a USB drive containing valuable corporate data could be lost.

- Removable Media

## Identify the data loss vector: Passwords or weak passwords which have been compromised can provide a threat actor with easy access to corporate data.

- Improper Access Control

<!-- 3.2: Threat Actors -->

# is a common term used to describe a threat actor. Originally the term referred to someone who was a skilled computer expert such as a programmer and a hack was a clever solution.

- Hacker 

## enumerate the types of hackers

- White Hat Hackers

- White Hat Hackers
- Gray Hat Hackers
- Black Hat Hackers

## These are ethical hackers who use their programming skills for good, ethical, and legal purposes. 

- White Hat Hackers

## These are individuals who commit crimes and do arguably unethical things, but not for personal gain or to cause damage. They may disclose a vulnerability to the affected organization after having compromised their network.

- Gray Hat Hackers

## These are unethical criminals who compromise computer and network security for personal gain, or for malicious reasons, such as attacking networks.

- Black Hat Hackers

## Hacking started in the ____ with phone freaking, or phreaking, which refers to using audio frequencies to manipulate phone systems.

- 1960s

## refers to using audio frequencies to manipulate phone systems

- phone freaking, or phreaking

## programs which dialed each telephone number in a given area in search of computers. When a computer was found, password-cracking programs were used to gain access.

- war dialing

## These are teenagers or inexperienced hackers running existing scripts, tools, and exploits, to cause harm, but typically not for profit.

- Script Kiddies

## These are usually gray hat hackers who attempt to discover exploits and report them to vendors, sometimes for prizes or rewards.

- Vulnerability Broker

## These are gray hat hackers who publicly protest organizations or governments by posting articles, videos, leaking sensitive information, and performing network attacks.

- Hacktivists

## These are black hat hackers who are either self-employed or working for large cybercrime organizations.

- Cyber criminals

## These are either white hat or black hat hackers who steal government secrets, gather intelligence, and sabotage networks. Their targets are foreign governments, terrorist groups, and corporations. Most countries in the world participate to some degree in state-sponsored hacking.

- State-Sponsored Hackers

## Two examples of hacktivist groups are ____.

- Anonymous 
- Syrian Electronic Army

## An example of a state-sponsored attack involves the ____ malware that was created to damage Iran’s nuclear enrichment capabilities.

- Stuxnet

<!-- 3.3: Threat Actor Tools -->

## often referred to as password recovery tools. This is accomplished either by removing the original password, after bypassing the data encryption, or by outright discovery of the password. These tools repeatedly make guesses in order to crack the password.

- Password Crackers

##  Examples of password cracking tools include:

- John the Ripper
- Ophcrack
- L0phtCrack
- THC Hydra
- RainbowCrack
- Medusa

## are used to intentionally hack into a wireless network to detect security vulnerabilities. 

- Wireless Hacking Tools

## are used to probe network devices, servers, and hosts for open TCP or UDP ports

- Network Scanning and
Hacking Tools

## These tools are used to probe and test a firewall’s robustness using specially crafted forged packets

- Packet Crafting Tools

<!-- Check Your Understanding - Threat Actor Tools -->

## Which penetration testing tool uses algorithm schemes to encode the data, which then prevents access to the data?

- Encryption Tools

## Which penetration testing tool is used by black hats to reverse engineer binary files when writing exploits? They are also used by white hats when analyzing malware.

- Debuggers

## Which penetration testing tool is used to probe and test a firewall’s robustness?

- Packet Crafting Tools

## Which penetration testing tool is used by white hat hackers to sniff out any trace of evidence existing in a computer?

- Forensic Tools

## Which penetration testing tool identifies whether a remote host is susceptible to a security attack?

- Vulnerability Exploitation Tools

<!-- 3.4: Malware -->

<!-- Check Your Understanding - Malware -->

## Which malware executes arbitrary code and installs copies of itself in the memory of the infected computer? The main purpose of this malware is to automatically replicate from system to system across the network.

- Worm

## Which malware is non-self-replicating type of malware? It often contains malicious code that is designed to look like something else, such as a legitimate application or file. It attacks the device from within.

- Trojan Horse

## Which malware is used to gather information about a user and then, without the user's consent, sends the information to another entity?

- Spyware

## Which malware typically displays annoying pop-ups to generate revenue for its author?

- Adware

## Which malware is installed on a compromised system and provides privileged access to the threat actor?

- Rootkit

## Which malware denies access to the infected computer system and demands payment before the restriction is removed?

- Ransomware
