<!-- Lesson 1: Introduction -->

## Computer security began on ____

- after the first mainframes were developed

## ____ control limit access to locations

- physical

## During the ____, the ____ began to examine the feasibility of redundant networked communications

- 1960s, Advanced Research Project Agency (ARPA)

## ____ developed the ARPANET from its inception

- Larry Roberts

## Fundamental problems with ARPANET that were identified during the 1970s and 80s.

- no safety procedures for dial-up connections
- non-existent user identification and authorization on the system

## During the 1970s and 80s, the scope of computer security grew from physical security to include:

- securing the data
- limiting random and unauthorized access to data
- involving personnel from multiple levels of the organization in information security

## Information security began with the ____. This is the paper that started the study of computer security.

- Rand Report R-609

## Early focues on computer security research was centered on system called ____.

- Multiplexed Information and Computing Service (MULTICS)

## A computer system developed in the mid-1960s by General Electric (GE), Bell Labs, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).

- Mainframe and Time-Sharing OS

## During the 1990s, the Internet became ____

- the first global network of networks

## The state of being secure and free from danger or harm; the actions taken to make someone or something secure.

- security

## The protection of informatio and its critical elements, including systems and hardware that use, store, and transmit that information.

- security

## C.I.A. triangle

- confidentiality
- integrity
- availability

## The ability to interact with a system or resource.

- access

## Something of value to an organization or individual.

- asset

## An intentional or unintentional act that targets a system or resource.

- attack

## A measure implemented to reduce or mitigate risk.

- control

## measure implemented to protect assets from potential threats.

- safeguard

## A specific action used to prevent or mitigate a particular type of attack.

- countermeasure

## A technique or tool that takes advantage of a vulnerability or weakness in a system.

- exploit

## The state of being vulnerable or at risk of harm.

- exposure

## The negative impact or harm caused by a security incident.

- loss

## A document that describes security requirements and objectives for a system or product.

- protection profile

## The likelihood and potential impact of a security incident.

- risk

## The entity being targeted or attacked.

- subject of attack

## The specific asset or resource being targeted or attacked.

- object of attack

## A potential danger or harm to an asset or system.

- threat

## The entity or object responsible for creating or initiating a threat.

- threat agent

## A weakness or flaw in a system or its security controls.

- vulnerability

## Security should be viewed as a balance between ____.

- protection and accessibility

## A critical characteristic of an information that enable authorized users to access information without interference and to receive it in the required format.

- Availability

## A standard designed to guide policies for information security within an organization.

- Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability (CIA)

##  A critical characteristic of an information that is protected from disclosure to unauthorized systems.

- Confidentiality

<!-- Lesson -->

## Responsible for the security and use of a particular set of information

- Data owners

<!-- Lesson -->

## In a NIST approach for securing SDLC; What's the key security involved?

- Integrating IS into its environment
- Planning and conducting system certification activities in synchronization with testing of security controls
- Completing system accreditation activities

## The need to include writing security requirements alongside functional requirements and performing an architecture risk analysis during the design phase of the SDLC.

- Software Assurance

## An SDLC phase that ends with a documentation of findings and update of feasibility.

- Analysis

## An SDLC phase where needed software is created.

- Implementation
