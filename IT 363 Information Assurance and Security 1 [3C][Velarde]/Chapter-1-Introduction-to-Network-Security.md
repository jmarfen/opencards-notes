## The state of being secure and free from danger or harm; the actions taken to make someone or something secure.

- security

## A sucessful organization should have multiple layers of security to protect:

- operations
- physical infrastructure
- people
- functions
- communications
- information

## The protection of information and its critical elements, including systems and hardware that use, store, and transmit that information.

- security

## C.I.A. triangle

- confidentiality
- integrity
- availability

## The ability to interact with a system or resource.

- access

## Something of value to an organization or individual.

- asset

## An intentional or unintentional act that targets a system or resource.

- attack

## A measure implemented to reduce or mitigate risk.

- control

## measure implemented to protect assets from potential threats.

- safeguard

## A specific action used to prevent or mitigate a particular type of attack.

- countermeasure

## A technique or tool that takes advantage of a vulnerability or weakness in a system.

- exploit

## The state of being vulnerable or at risk of harm.

- exposure

## The negative impact or harm caused by a security incident.

- loss

## A document that describes security requirements and objectives for a system or product.

- protection profile

## The likelihood and potential impact of a security incident.

- risk

## The entity being used to target or attack.

- subject of attack

## The specific asset or resource being targeted or attacked.

- object of attack

## A potential danger or harm to an asset or system.

- threat

## The entity or object responsible for creating or initiating a threat.

- threat agent

## A weakness or flaw in a system or its security controls.

- vulnerability


## A standard designed to guide policies for information security within an organization.

- Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability (CIA)

<!-- Lesson 2 - Critical Characteristics of Information -->

## A critical characteristic of an information that enable authorized users to access information without interference and to receive it in the required format.

- Availability

## A quality of information being free from mistakes or errors and has value the end user expects.

- Accuracy

## A quality or state of information being genuine or original,rather than a reproduction or fabrication.

- Authenticity

## Information is ____ when it is in the same state in which it was created, transferred. and stored.

- Authentic

##  A critical characteristic of an information that is protected from disclosure to unauthorized individuals or systems.

- Confidentiality

## This characteristic ensures that only users with the rights and privileges can access information

- Confidentiality

## Characteristic of information being whole, complete, and uncorrupted.

- Integrity

## Quality or state of information having value to some purpose or end.

- Utility

## Quality or state of ownership or control of information.

- Possession

## Components of an information system:

- software
- hardware
- data
- people
- procedures
- networks

## Security should be viewed as a balance between ____.

- protection and accessibility

## Approaches to information security implementation:

- Grassroots effort
- Top-down approach

## This approach in information security implementation involves systems administrators attempting to improve security on their own.

- Grassroots effort

## This approach in information security implementation is initiated by upper management

- Top-down approach


<!-- Lesson 3 - Phases of SDLC -->

## A methodology for the design and implementation of an information system

- Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

## A format approach to solving a problem based on a structured sequence of procedures

- methodology

## Advantages of using a methodology:

- ensures a rigorous process with a clearly defined goal
- increases probability of success

## Six phases of traditional SDLC:

- investigation
- analysis
- logical design
- physical design
- implementation
- maintenance and change

## SDLC phase where objectives, scope, and cost-benefit analysis is conducted

- Investigation

## SDLC phase where the organization, current systems, proposed system is assessed

- Analysis

## SDLC phase where data support and structures are defined

- Logical Design

## SDLC phase where technologies and components are identified and evaluated

- Physical Design

## SDLC phase where the needed software is created

- Implementation

## SDLC phase that is the longest and most expensive. Consists of tasks necessary to support the system.

- Maintenance and change

## Uses the same phases in traditional SDLC but adapted for security systems

- SecSDLC

## This phase begins with an enterprise information security policy (EISP)

- Investigation

## This document outlines the implementation of a security program within the organization

- enterprise information security policy (EISP)

## This phase includes analysis of relevant legal issues, risk management, and existing security policies

- Analysis

## This phase involves the creation of blueprints for information security

- Logical Design

## This phase includes evaluation of information security technologies needed to support the blueprint

- Physical Design

## This phases is where security solutions are acquired, tested, and implemented

- Implementation

## This phase includes repairing damage and restoring information from attacks

- Maintenance and change

<!-- Lesson 4 - Software Design Principles -->

## Security principles identified by J.H. Saltzer and M.D. Shroeder

- economy of mechanism
- fail-safe defaultss
- complete mediation
- open design
- separation of privilege
- least privilege
- least common mechanism
- psychological acceptability

## Phases of the NIST approach

- Initiation
- Development/Acquisition
- Implementation/Assessment
- Operations and Maintenance
- Disposal

## In a NIST approach for securing SDLC; What's the key security involved?

- Integrating IS into its environment
- Planning and conducting system certification activities in synchronization with testing of security controls
- Completing system accreditation activities

## A small functional team of people who are experienced in one or more facts of technical and non-technical areas

- Information Security Project Team

## Responsible for the security and use of a particular set of information

- Data owners

## Responsible for information and systems that process, transmit, and store data

- Data custodian

## Individuals with information security roles

- Data users

## Examines the behavior of individuals interacting with systems

- Social science

## The need to include writing security requirements alongside functional requirements and performing an architecture risk analysis during the design phase of the SDLC.

- Software Assurance

## An SDLC phase that ends with a documentation of findings and update of feasibility.

- Analysis
