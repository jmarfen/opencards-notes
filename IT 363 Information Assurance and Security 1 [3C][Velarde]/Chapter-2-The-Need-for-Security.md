<!-- Chapter 2 - The Need for Security -->

<!-- Lesson 1 - Introduction -->

## The primary mission of an information security program is to-

- ensure information assets, and
- ensure systems that house them remain safe and useful

## Information security performs four important functions for an organization:

- protecting the organization's ability to function
- protecting the daya and information the organization collects and uses
- enabling the safe operation of applications running on the organization's IT systems
- safeguarding the organization's technology assets

## ____ is responsible for facilitating security program

- management (general and IT)

## Implementing information security has more to do with ____ than technology

- management

## Communities of interest should address information security in terms of:

- business impact
- cost of business interruption

## As a critical aspect of information security, data must be protected during:

- transmission
- processing
- rest/storage

<!-- Lesson 2 - Threats -->

## ____ is a potential risk to an asset's loss of value

- threat

## Management must be informed about the various threats to an organization's:

- people
- applications
- data
- information systems

## Creation, ownership, and control of original ideas as well as the representation of those ideas

- intellectual property (IP)

## The most common IP breaches involve ____

- soft piracy

## Deviations in Quality of Service

- Internet service issues
- Communications and other service provider issues
- Power irregularities

## Access of protected information by unauthorized individuals

- espionage/tresspassing

## legal form of information gathering on competitors

- competitive intelligence

## covert and sometimes illegal form of investigating competitors to gain an advantage

- industrial espionage

## method of gaining protected information by being physically close or looking over someone's shoulder

- shoulder surfing

## These are hackers who develop exploits and share them with others

- expert hackers

## These are hackers who use software written by others to exploit systems and do not fully understand the systems they hack

- unskilled hackers

## These are hackers who remove software protection designed to prevent unathorized distribution/duplication

- crackers

## These are hackers who hack the public telephone system to make free calls or disrupt services

- phreakers

## Different types of password attacks

- cracking
- brute force
- dictionary
- rainbow tables
- social engineering

## The process of recovering passwords from stored data

- cracking

## A trial and error method of submitting as many passwords as possible until the correct one is found

- brute force

## Method of gaining access to a system by entering every word in a dictionary as a password

- dictionary attack

## A precomputed table containing the outputs of a cryptographic function used for cracking passwords

- rainbow table

## Information Threats can be prevented through:

- training
- awareness
- controls

## The of social manipulation tactics to convince people to reveal access credentials or other valuable information to an attacker

- social engineering

## A type of scam where the recipient is due to receive money but a small advance fee/personal information is required to get the promised reward

- advance fee fraud

## An attempt to gain personal/confidential information by using a fake  website pretending to be a legitimate site

- phishing

## Attacker steals information from a computer system and demands compensation for its return or non-disclosure.

- information extortion

<!-- Lesson 3 - Software Attacks -->

## is used to overwhelm systems or gain access to protected systems

- malicious software (malware)

## occurs when an individual or a group designs and deployes software to attack a system

- software attack

## consists of code segments that attach to existing programs and take control of access to the targeted computer

- virus

## they replicate themselves until they completely fill available resources such as memory and hard drive space

- worms

## malware disguised as helpful, interesting, or necessary pieces of software

- trojan hourses

## type of malware which continuousls mutates or evolves to evade detection

- polymorphic threat/virus

## nonexistent malware that people waste time spreading awareness about

- virus and worm hoaxes

## way of gaining access to a system or network using known or newly discovered access mechanisms

- backdoor

## Type of attack where large number of requests are sent to a targe in order to overwhelm

- Denial-of-service (DoS)

## A coordinated stream of requests launched against a target from multiple locations simultaneously

- Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS)

## Type of attack where an attacker routes large quantities of email to overwhelm the receiver

- mail bombing

## unsolicited emails, considered as a nuisance but may also be a vector for some attacks

- spam

## software used to monitor data traveling through a network

- packet sniffer

## A technique used to gain unauthorized access; the intruder assumes a trusted IP address

- IP spoofing

## Type of attack where DNS records are modified to redirect users to an illegitimate site for the purpose of obtaining private information

- pharming

## An attacker monitors the network, modifies them, then inserts them back before being sent to the recipient

- man-in-the-middle

<!-- Lesson 4 - Technical Hardware -->

## Occurs when a manufacturer distributes equipment containing a known or unknown flaw

- technical hardware failure/error

## Common failures in sofware development

- buffer overruns
- command injection
- cross-site scripting (XSS)
- failure to handle errors
- failure to protect network traffic
- failure to store cryptographically strong random numbers
- format string problems
- neglecting change protocol
- improper file access
- improper use of SSL
- information leakage
- integer bugs (overflows/underflows)
- race conditions
- SQL injection

## Problem areas in software development

- trusting network address resolution
- unauthenticated key exchange
- use of magic URLs and hidden forms
- use of weak password-based systems
- poor usability

## Occurs when a product or service is no longer needed, wanted, or serviced even though it is still functional.

- technological obsolescence

## Illegal taking of another's physical, electronic, or intellectual property

- theft

## An objective in SDLC recognizing the need for creating a secure system.

- software assurance

## Common security principles in software design

- keep design simple and small
- access decisions by permission, not inclusion
- every access to every object checked for authority
- design depends on possession of keys/passwords
- protection mechanisms require two keys to unlock
- programs/users/utilize only necessary priviledges
- minimize mechanisms common to multiple users
- human interface must be easy to use so users routinely/automatically use protection mechanisms

## What are the four important functions of information security?

- protects organization's ability to function
- enables safe operation of applications implemented on organization's IT system
- protects data the organization collects and uses
- safeguars the technology assets in use at the organization

## An object, person, or other entity representing a constant danger to an asset

- threat

##  A deliberate act that exploits vulnerability

- attack

## Management can effectively protect information through:

- policy
- education
- training
- technology controls
