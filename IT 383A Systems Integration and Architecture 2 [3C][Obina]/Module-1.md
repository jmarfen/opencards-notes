system integration

## Scope of enterprise architecture

- people
- processes
- information technology
- their relationships to each other
- external environment

## According to this school, the purpose of enterprise architecture is the greater alignment between IT and business concerns. 

enterprise IT design

## According to this school, the purpose of EA is to achieve greater coherence across an organization's many concerns 

enterprise integrating

## According to this school, the purpose of enterprise architecture is to support and maintain an organization's capacity for learning so that it may be sustained.

enterprise ecological adaptation

## enterprise architecture contributes to the following goals:

- IT complexity
- IT risk management

## goal: Enterprise architecture supports ____ in domains related to the creation and revision of organizational structures during broad organizational change.

organizational design

## goal: The collaboration and communication amongst project stakeholders is improved by enterprise architecture

project management

## goal: By making the business architecture documentation publicly available, enterprise architecture improves the efficiency of requirement elicitation and the precision of requirement definitions

requirements engineering

## goal: Enterprise architecture contributes to the reduction of time needed for technology-related decision-making by helping establish discipline and standardization of IT planning processes.

IT management and decision-making

## goal: Enterprise design helps avoid duplication of IT infrastructure services among business divisions and lower system deployment and operational expenses.

IT value

## goal: The linkage of data and applications, as well as improved system interoperability

IT complexity

## goal: Reduction of business risks from system failures and security breaches.

IT risk management

## ____ was developed by John Zachman while with IBM in the 1980s, after observing the building and airplane construction industries and the IT industry. 

Enterprise Architecture

## Who developed enterprise architecture? When and where?

John Zachman, 1980, IBM

## Three questions in enterprise architecture

- What
- How
- Where

## is a structure for arranging architectural artifacts that consider both the targets of the artifact (such as business owners and system builders) and the specific problem that is being addressed (for example, data and functionality)
