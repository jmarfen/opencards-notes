<!-- Module 1: Introduction to System Integration and Architecture -->

<!-- Lesson 1: Architecture and Enterprise Engineering -->

## Is a guide map that can reduce risks of project implementation

enterprise architecture

## A method for managing your business or enterprise. It is a decision-making, change management tool and the knowledgebase of your business or enterprise.

enterprise architecture

## Scope of enterprise architecture

- people
- processes
- information technology
- their relationships to each other
- external environment

## what are the three schools of thought in enterprise architecture?

- enterprise IT design
- enterprise integrating
- enterprise ecological adaptation

## According to this school of thought, the goal of enterprise architecture is the greater alignment between IT and business concerns. 

enterprise IT design

## According to this school of thought, the purpose of EA is to achieve greater coherence across an organization's many concerns 

enterprise integrating

## According to this school of thought, the purpose of enterprise architecture is to support and maintain an organization's capacity for learning so that it may be sustained.

enterprise ecological adaptation

## enterprise architecture contributes/gives advantages to the following goals:

- organizational design
- project management
- requirements engineering
- IT management and decision-making
- IT value
- IT complexity
- IT risk management

## goal: Enterprise architecture supports ____ in domains related to the creation and revision of organizational structures during broad organizational change.

organizational design

## goal: The collaboration and communication amongst project stakeholders is improved by enterprise architecture

project management

## goal: By making the business architecture documentation publicly available, enterprise architecture improves the efficiency of requirement elicitation and the precision of requirement definitions

requirements engineering

## goal: Enterprise architecture contributes to the reduction of time needed for technology-related decision-making by helping establish discipline and standardization of IT planning processes.

IT management and decision-making

## goal: Enterprise design helps avoid duplication of IT infrastructure services among business divisions and lower system deployment and operational expenses.

IT value

## goal: The linkage of data and applications, as well as improved system interoperability

IT complexity

## goal: Reduction of business risks from system failures and security breaches.

IT risk management

## These are people who create the solutions to address the business challenges and support the enterprise in implementing those solutions. 

enterprise architects

## The ____ connects an organization's corporate mission, strategy, and business processes to its IT strategy in order to demonstrate how the organization's present and future demands will be satisfied effectively, sustainably, and adaptable.

enterprise architect

## ____ was developed by John Zachman while with IBM in the 1980s, after observing the building and airplane construction industries and the IT industry. 

Enterprise Architecture

## Who developed enterprise architecture? When and where?

John Zachman, 1980, IBM

## Three questions in enterprise architecture

- What
- How
- Where

## is a structure for arranging architectural artifacts that consider both the targets of the artifact (such as business owners and system builders) and the specific problem that is being addressed (for example, data and functionality)

Zachman framework

## Six rows of the Zachman framework

- Planner’s View (Scope Contexts) 
- Owner’s View (Business Concepts) 
- Designer’s View (System Logic)
- Implementer’s View (Technology Physics) 
- Sub-Constructor’s View (Component Assembles)
- User’s View (Operations Classes) 

## This view describes the business purpose and strategy, defining the playing field for the other views.

Planner’s View (Scope Contexts) 

## This view reveals which parts of the enterprise can be automated.

Owner’s View (Business Concepts) 

## This view outlines how the system will satisfy the organization’s information needs.

Designer’s View (System Logic)

## This is a representation of how the system will be implemented while addressing production constraints.

Implementer’s View (Technology Physics) 

## These representations illustrate the implementation-specific details of certain system elements.

Sub-Constructor’s View (Component Assembles)

## This is a view of the functioning system in its operational environment.

User’s View (Operations Classes) 

## What are the interrogatives or questions that are asked of the enterprise?

- **What (data)** – What is the business data, information, or objects?
- **How (function)** – How does the business work by defining processes?
- **Where (network)** – Where are the business operations?
- **When (time)** – When are the business processes performed?
- **Why (motivation)** – Why is the solution chosen, how was it derived and what motivates the performance of certain activities?

## What is the business data, information, or objects?

What (**data**)

## How does the business work by defining processes?

Where (**network**)

## When are the business processes performed?

When (**time**)

## Why is the solution chosen, how was it derived and what motivates the performance of certain activities?

Why (**motivation**)

<!-- Lesson 2: System Integration -->

## is the act of fusing hardware and software components into a single, cohesive architecture, allowing each component to function independently.

system integration

## The term "____" describes the outcome of a process designed to bring together many, frequently divergent subsystems so that the data contained in each becomes a part of a larger, more complete system that, in theory, rapidly and readily distributes data as needed

system integration

## the process of joining software and hardware modules into one cohesive infrastructure, enabling all pieces to work as a whole

system integration

## Advantages of system integration:

- Increased Productivity
- Accurate and Trustworthy Data
- Faster decision-making
- Cost-effectiveness

## Identify the advantage. Integrated systems improve workflow efficiency by enabling centralized control over everyday operations

- Increased Productivity

## Identify the advantage. Data is updated all over the components of the system concurrently keeping all the departments informed.

- Accurate and Trustworthy Data

## Identify the advantage. Data is no longer dispersed among compartmentalized storages. So, you don't need to manually download and export it to the centralized repository in order to run analytics.

- Faster decision-making

## Identify the advantage. System integration is less expensive than replacing every disconnected component with a brand-new integrated system

- Cost-effectiveness

## Ideas on how to connect systems:

- Application programming interfaces (APIs) 
- Middleware
- Webhooks
- Electronic Data Interchange (EDI)

## most popular and simple method of connecting two systems.  An example is online service providers — from social media to travel platforms.

- Application programming interfaces (APIs) 

## the unnoticed software layer that links distributed systems, applications, services, and devices together. It holds different tasks such as data management, messaging, API management, or authentication

- Middleware

## also called HTTP callbacks, are real-time messages, sent by one system to another when a certain event happens.

- Webhooks

## Webhooks are also called ____

HTTP callbacks

## is the replacement of paper documents with the sharing of business information in a common electronic format with no people involved.

- Electronic Data Interchange (EDI)
