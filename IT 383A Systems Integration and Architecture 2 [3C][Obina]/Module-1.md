## Who developed enterprise architecture? When and where?

John Zachman, 1980, IBM

## Three questions in enterprise architecture

- What
- How
- Where

## is a structure for arranging architectural artifacts that consider both the targets of the artifact (such as business owners and system builders) and the specific problem that is being addressed (for example, data and functionality)

Zachman framework

## Six rows of the Zachman framework

- Planner's View 
- Owner's View

- Implementer's View
- Sub-Constructor's View
- User's View

## This view describes the business purpose and strategy, defining the playing field for the other views.

## This view reveals which parts of the enterprise can be automated.

Owner’s View (Business Concepts) 

## This view outlines how the system will satisfy the organization’s information needs.

Designer’s View (System Logic)

## 

## the process of joining software and hardware modules into one cohesive infrastructure, enabling all pieces to work as a whole
