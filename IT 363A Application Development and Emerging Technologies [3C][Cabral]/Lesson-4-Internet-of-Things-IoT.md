sensors

## According to ____, ____ is the networking ofvsmart objects, meaning a huge number of devices intelligently communicating in the presence of internet protocol that cannot be directly operated by human beings but exist as components in buildings, vehicles or the environment.

Internet Architecture Board (IAB), Internet of Things (IoT)

## According to the ____'s definition, ____ is the networking of smart objects in which smart objects have some constraints such as limited bandwidth, power, and processing accessibility for achieving interoperability among smart objects.

Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), Internet of Things (IoT)

## is the network of physical objects or "things" embedded with electronics, software, sensors, and network connectivity, which enables these objects to collect and exchange data.

Internet of Things (IoT)

## the first radio voice transmission took place on ____

June 3, 1900

## The development of computers began in the ____

1950s

## The Internet, itself a significant component of the IoT, started out as part of DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) in 1962 and evolved into ARPANET in ____.

1969

## In the ____, commercial service providers began supporting public use of ARPANET,allowing it to evolve into our modern Internet.

1980s

## Global Positioning Satellites (GPS) became a reality in early ____, with the Department of Defense providing a stable, highly functional system of 24 satellites.

1993

## The Internet of Things, as a concept, wasn’t officially named until ____.

1999

## ____, the Executive Director of Auto-ID Labs at MIT, was the first to describe the Internet of Things, during his 1999 speech.

Radio Frequency Identification

## Advantages of IoT

- improved customer engagemnt
- technology optimization
- reduced waste
- enhanced data collection

## Identify the advantage mentioned: Current analytics suffer from blind-spots and significant flaws inaccuracy; and as noted, engagement remains passive. IoT completely transforms this to achieve richer and more effective engagement with audiences.

improved customer engagemnt

## Identify the advantage mentioned: − The same technologies and data which improve the customer experience also improve device use, and aid in more potent improvements to technology. IoT unlocks a world of critical functional and field data.

technology optimization

## Identify the advantage mentioned: IoT makes areas of improvement clear. Current analytics give us superficial insight, but IoT provides real-world information leading to the more effective management of resources.

reduced waste

## Identify the advantage mentioned: Modern data collection suffers from its limitations and its design for passive use. IoT breaks it out of those spaces and places it exactly where humans really want to go to analyze our world. It allows an accurate picture of everything.

enhanced data collection

## Disadvantages of IoT

- hacking and stealing confidential information
- software bugs and corruption
- compatibility issues with different manufacturers
- scalability

## Challenges of IoT

- security
- privacy
- complexity
- flexibility
- compliance

## IoT creates an ecosystem of constantly connected devices communicating over networks. The system offers little control despite any security measures. This leaves users exposed to various kinds of attackers.

security

## The sophistication of IoT provides substantial personal data in extreme detail without the user's active participation.

privacy

## Some find IoT systems complicated in terms of design, deployment, and maintenance given their use of multiple technologies and a large set of new enabling technologies.

complexity

## Many are concerned about the flexibility of an IoT system to integrate easily with another. They worry about finding themselves with several conflicting or locking systems.

flexibility

## IoT, like any other technology in the realm of business, must comply with regulations. Its complexity makes the issue of compliance seem incredibly challenging when many consider standard software compliance a battle.

compliance

## An ____ tem consists of web-enabled smart devices that use embedded processors, sensors and communication hardware to collect, send and act on data they acquire from their environments.

IoT ecosystem

# an IoT device can be explained as a network of things that consists of:

- hardware
- software
- network connectivity
- sensors

## architecture of IoT devices comprises four major components:

- sensing layer
- network layer
- data processing layer
- application layer

## The main purpose of the ____ is to identify any phenomena in the devices’ peripheral and obtain data from the real world.

sensing layer

## acts as a communication channel to transfer data, collected in the sensing layer, to other connected devices.

network layer

## this layer consists of the main data processing unit of IoT devices.

data processing layer

## this layer implements and presents the results of the data processing layer to accomplish disparate applications of IoT devices.

application layer

## categories of IoT devices:

- consumer
- enterprise
- industrial

## ____ connected devices include smart TVs, smart speakers, toys, wearables, and smart appliances.

consumer

## in ____, smart sensors located in a conference room can help an employee locate and schedule an available room for a meeting, ensuring the proper room type, size and features are available.

enterprise
