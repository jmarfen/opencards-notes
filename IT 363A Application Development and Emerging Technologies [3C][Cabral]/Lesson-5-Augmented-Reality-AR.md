<!-- Lesson 5: Augmented Reality (AR) -->

## a form of emerging technology that allows users to overlay computer-generated content in the real world.

augmented reality (AR)

## refers to a live view of a physical real-world environment whose elements are merged with augmented computer-generated images creating a mixed reality.

augmented reality (AR)

## is fully immersive, which tricks your senses into thinking youâ€™re in a different environment or world apart from the real world.

virtual reality (VR)

## VR is also called a ____

computer-simulated reality

## examples of VR devices:

- HTC Vive
- Oculus Rift
- Google Cardboard

## In ____, users see and interact with the real world while digital content is added to it.

augmented reality (AR)

## sometimes referred to as hybrid reality, is the merging of real and virtual worlds to produce new environments and visualizations where physical and digital objects co-exist and interact in real-time.

mixed reality

## examples of MR devices

- Microsoft HoloLens
- Magic Leap One

## main compomnents of AR systems

- infrastructure tracker unit
- processing  unit
- visual unit

## this unit is responsible for collecting data from the real world

infrastructure tracker unit

## two systems of visual units

- **video see-through**: It uses a Head-Mounted Display (HMD) that employs a video-mixing and displays the merged images on a closed-view HMD.
- **optical see-through**: It uses an HMD that employs optical combiners to merge the images within an open-view HMD.

- medicine
- entertainment

## Augmented reality allows flexibility in use that is attractive to education.

AR in education

## reasons for using AR in education

- affordable learning materials
- interactive lessons
- higher engagement
- higher retention
- boosts intellectual curiosity

## Using AR technology allows for avoiding investments in physical materials.

affordable learning materials

## when AR technology is used in classrooms, students can view models on their own smartphones and get a better idea of the concepts they are studying.

interactive lessons

## when teachers integrate augmented reality into their lectures, they attract the attention of their students and make lessons more effective.

higher engagement

## using the AR app, students can get access to augmented models that represent any real objects from a famous monument or work of art to a molecule.

higher retention

## augmented reality makes students more excited about learning certain subjects.

boost intellectual curiosity

## augmented reality has already made significant changes in the following medical areas:

- surgery
- education of future doctors
- diagnostics
- detecting signs of depression and other mental disorders

## applications of AR in medicine:

- describing symptoms
- nursing care
- surgery
- ultrasound
- diabetes management
- navigation

## applications of AR in entertainment

- AR in games
- AR in music
- AR on TV
- AR in eSports
- AR in the theater
