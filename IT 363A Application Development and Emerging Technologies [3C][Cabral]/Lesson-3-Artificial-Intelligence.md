## Levels of AI

- Stage 1: Rule-based Systems
- Stage 2: Context Awareness and Retention
- Stage 3: Domain-specific Expertise
- Stage 4: Reasoning Machines
- Stage 5: Self-aware Systems/Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)
- Stage 6: Artificial Superintelligence (ASI)
- Stage 7: Singularity and Trancendence

## The most common uses of AI today fit in this bracket, covering everything from business software (Robotic Process Automation) and domestic appliances to aircraft autopilots.

Stage 1: Rule-based Systems

## Algorithms that develop information about the specific domain they are being applied in. They are trained on the knowledge and experience of the best humans, and their knowledge base can be updated as new situations and queries arise. Well, known applications of this level are chatbots and “roboadvisors”.

Stage 2: Context Awareness and Retention

## Going beyond the capability of humans, these systems build up expertise in a specific context taking in massive volumes of information which they can use for decision making. Successful use cases have been seen in cancer diagnosis and the well-known Google Deepmind’s AlphaGo.

Stage 3: Domain-specific Expertise

## An example of a domain-specific AI is ____

Google Deepmind's AlphaGo

## These algorithms have some ability to attribute mental states to themselves and others – they have a sense of beliefs, intentions, knowledge, and how their own logic works. This means they could reason or negotiate with humans and other machines.

Stage 4: Reasoning Machines

## These systems have human-like intelligence – the most commonly portrayed AI in media – however, no such use is in evidence today.

Stage 5: Self-aware Systems/Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)

## AI algorithms can outsmart even the most intelligent humans in every domain. Logically it is difficult for humans to articulate what the capabilities might be, yet we would hope examples would include solving problems we have failed to so far, such as world hunger and dangerous environmental change.

Stage 6: Artificial Superintelligence (ASI)

## leads to a massive expansion in human capability. Human augmentation could connect our brains to each other and to a future successor of the current internet, creating a “hive mind” that shares ideas, solves problems collectively, and even gives others access to our dreams as observers or participants. Pushing this idea further, we might go beyond the limits of the human body and connect to other forms of intelligence on the planet – animals, plants, weather systems, and the natural environment.

Stage 7: Singularity and Trancendence

## Seven levels of AI maturity

1. Perception
2. Notification
3. Suggestion
4. Automation
5. Prediction
6. Prevention
7. Situational Awareness

## Artificial Intelligence Type-1: Based on Capabilities

- Weak/Narrow AI
- General AI
- Strong/Super AI

## Artificial Intelligence Type-2: Based on Functionality

- Reactive machines
- Limited memory
- Theory of Mind
- Self-awareness

## Layers of AI systems

- sensing layer
- interpretation layer
- interacting layer

## data is not contained in a regular database and is growing exponentially, making up most of the data in the world.
