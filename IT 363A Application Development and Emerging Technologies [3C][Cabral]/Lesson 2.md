## a multi-disciplinary field that uses scientific methods to extact knowledge and insights from data

data science

## representation of facts, concepts, or instructions in a formalized manner

data

## is the processed data on which decisions and actions are based

information

## is interpreted data, created from data in a particular context

information

## the restructuring or re-ordering of data to increase usefulness for a particular purpose

data processing

## steps in data processing

- input
- processing
- output

## common data types

- integers
- booleans
- characters
- floating-point numbers
- alphanumeric strings

## data that adheres to a predefined data model

structured data

## examples of structed data

- ms excel files
- sql databases

## form of data that does not conform with a formal structure but contains tags and markers to separate semantic elements and enforce hierarchies of records and fields.
