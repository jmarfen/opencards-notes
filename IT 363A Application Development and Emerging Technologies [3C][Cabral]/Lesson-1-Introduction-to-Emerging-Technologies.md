<!-- Lesson 1: Introduction to Emerging Technologies -->

## define emerging technology

technologies currently being developed expected to be available within the next five to ten years

## define technology

- discoure or treatise on an art or the arts (1610s, Greek tekhnologia)
- science of the mechanical and industrial arts (1859)

## define evolution

process of developing by gradual changes, from Latin evolutio "an unrolling or opening", and e- "out", and volvere "to roll"

## List some currently available emerged technologies

- artificial intelligence
- blockchain
- AR and VR
- cloud computing 
- angular and react
- DevOps
- Internet of Things (IoT)
- Intelligent Apps (I-Apps)
- Big Data
- Robotic Process Automation (RPA)

## A period of major industrialization during the late 1700s and early 1800s

Industrial revolution

## First industrial revolution

mechanization through water and steam power

## Second industial revolution

mass production and assembly lines with electricity

## Third industrial revolution

computers and automation

## Transportation inventions during the industrial revolution

steam engine, railroad, diesel engine, airplane

## Communication inventions during the industrial revolution

telegraph, transatlantic cable. phonograph, telephone

## Industry innovations during the industrial revolution

cotton gin, sewing machine, electric lights

## Where industrial revolution began

Great Britain, late 1770s

## types of industries

- primary industry
- secondary industry
- tertiary industry
- quaternary industry

## primary industry involves

getting raw materials (e.g. farming, mining)

## secondary industry involves

manufacturing (e.g. cars, steel)

## tertiary industry involves

services (e.g. teaching and nursing)

## quaternary industry involves

research and development (e.g. IT)

## second industrial revolution began during

1870s

## third industrial revolution began during

late 1950s

## The third industrial revolution is also called as

Digital Revolution

## The stage in industrial revolution characterized by robotics. IoT, and cyberphysical systems

Fourth Industrial Revolution

## a mechanism controlled or monitored by computer-based algorithms

cyberphysical systems

## store information such as spreadsheets or database

memory devices

## executes software instructions

microprocessor

## provide specific functiosn, including device-to-device interfacing, communication, and signal processing

logic devices

## CPLD

Complex Programmable Logic Devices

## refers to communication and interaction between humans and machines

human-machine interaction

## the study of how people interact with computers

human-computer interaction (HCI)

## list some future trends in emerging technologies

- 5G and 6G
- artificial intelligence
- blockchain
- digital twins
- augmented analytics
- enhanced edge computing
- autonomous devices
- immersive experiences in smart spaces
