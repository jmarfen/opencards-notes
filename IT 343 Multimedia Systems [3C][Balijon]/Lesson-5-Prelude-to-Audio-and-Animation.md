<!-- Lesson 5: Prelude to Audio and Animation -->

<!-- The Nature of Sound -->

## how high or low a sound is

pitch

## describes sounds with frequencies below 20 Hz

infrasonic

## describes sounds with frequencies above 20,000 Hz

ultrasonic

## the speed of ____ depends on the medium

sound

## sound travels faster in solid than liquids

true

## is determined by the frequency of the sound wave

pitch

## the average human hearing ranges from ____ to ____

20 Hz to 20,000 Hz

## the lowest frequency a pipe organ can make is ____

40 Hz

## the apparent shift in sound frequency caused by motion of either the listener or the source

doppler effect

## is related to amplitude

loudness

## loudness is measued in ____

dB (decibels)

## used to visually represent waves

oscilloscope

## converts sound waves into current

microphone

## highest point in a wave is called

crest

## lowest point in a wave is called

trough

## the high point in a sound wave represents

compression

## the low point in a sound wave represents

rarefaction

<!-- Basic Audio Editing -->

## x-axis in waveform represents

time

## y-axis in wavefrom represents

amplitude

## audio containing two waveforms

stereo

## examples of audio editing software

- adobe audition
- sony sound forge
- audacity

## the process of combining multiple audio

audio mixing

## x-axis in spectral view

time

## y-axis in spectral view

frequency

## color in spectral view

amplitude

## common functions used to change volume

- fade in
- fade out
- envelope

## supresses volume at the beginning of the audio

fade in

## supresses volume at the end of the audio

fade out

## let you use a curve to specify areas where volume will change

envelope

## useful for removing background noises

noise reduction

## chipmunk voice has

highher pitch

## darth vader voice has

lower pitch

## helium voice has

faster speed

## slow-motion voice has

slow speed

## can create a feeling of a large auditorium or a small bathroom

reverb

## general steps in digital audio recording touch-up

1. noise reduction
2. trimming
3. adjusting volume

## this effect lets you change audio amplitude

normalize [according to sir deofel]
