## Principles of composition:

1. Zoom in
2. Rule of thirds
3. Use of frames, lines, and diagonals
4. Dramatic perspective

## The use of ____ create impact that lead the viewer's eye into and around the picture

- frames and real/inferred lines

## Triangle of exposure:

- Aperture
- Shutter Speed
- ISO

## refers to the size of camera's lens opening

- Aperture

## This camera setting affects the depth of field

- Aperture

## refers to the range of distance in focus

- Depth of field

## This camera setting how sharp or blurry moving objects are captured.

- Shutter speed

## Blur-free action shots need a high shutter speed (True/False)

- True

## A larger aperture allows more light to pass through (True/False)

- True

## measures the sensitivity of the image sensor

- ISO

## A lower ISO setting (e.g. 100) leads to less noise/finer grain (True/False)

- True

## ____ lenses allow more of a picture to be captured (need focal point) 

- wide-angle

## ____ lenses tighten the scene and isolate the subject (but affect the depth of field & increase camera shake)

 - telephoto
